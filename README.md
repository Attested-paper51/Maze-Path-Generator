# Maze-Path-Generator 		
•	Created a program that uses recursion to generate a path from one point(G) to another(H)
•	The maze is read from either "mz1.txt" or "mz2.txt" file that is provided
•	With each compilation, the two points, "H" and "G" are placed in random locations throughout the maze
•	The path is generated in the form of symbols based on the appropriate direction (>,<,^,v)
•	Challenges include the manipulation of 2-D arrays and recursion
