# Maze-Path-Generator
•	Created a program that uses recursion to generate a path from one point to another
•	The maze is read from a "maze.txt" file that is given
•	With each compilation, the two points are placed in random locations throughout the maze
•	The path is generated in the form of symbols based on the appropriate direction
•	Challenges include the manipulation of 2-D arrays and recursion
